  description: Web-app for invoice printing
---
When starting my carreer as a <strong>freelance webdeveloping specialist</strong>. That's when I knew I need to have a handy billing tool to write estimates and invoices and have them saved all in one place. After evaluating several billing or invoicing tools i had a clear goal. My <strong>high quality demand</strong> to have as small a file size as possible as a printed PDF in my own design would cause me to create it myself.</p>

After finishing my <a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-P393XW0K/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="certificate yeah">React tutorial</a> of 36 hours video courses plus coding challenges and with my experience with <a href="/works/jspdf-template/">creating PDF's</a> I was set up for this little project of my own. By investing 111,5 hours of work on the <strong>React App</strong>, connecting <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="go to Firebase website">Firebase</a> and fiddling out the data-connection to print the resulting PDF's. Integrated testing with <a href="https://jestjs.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="go to Jest website">Jest</a> in connection with <a href="https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="go to Enzyme doc website">Enzyme</a>. First it felt like building the app around the printing process. But in the End printing the PDF is just a component and the end of a <strong>User story</strong>. This project is a lot about <strong>user interaction</strong> with <a href="https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="used this for the forms">forms</a> and different kind of inputs. I did finish the version 1.0.0 in end of October 2018.

Having this very own custom piece of software let's me personally bend the tool to fit what I really need for my daily paperwork. This is what <strong>software</strong> shall do. Helping me out. Other than that i had a good learning curve on how this technology stack apps are working.
