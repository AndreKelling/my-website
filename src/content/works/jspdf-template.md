With the help of the <a href="https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="JavaScript Library">jsPDF</a> library by MrRio i relaunched my Invoice Design with the mighty power of JavaScript code.<br />
Printing PDF's with code was and is a little nightmare. PDF's are created with PostScript and that doesn't works well with any Markup language like HTML.

This will simply improve my speed in writing invoices. Hopefully i will do write a lot.<br />
Served with integrated SVG graphics is gentle on resources. Because of the optimized datasize ~100kb instead of delivering several mb's sized documents.

This template gots what it needs to restructure it as a simple letter. As it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_5008" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="DIN 5008 german letter standart">DIN 5008</a> conform.<br />
Here you can test this out <a href="https://andrekelling.github.io/jspdf-template/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="to github page">https://andrekelling.github.io/jspdf-template/</a>

With some tweaks here and there I can do apply your design on this and connected to a User Interface which could deliver data into the creation-code you could print your stuff in your own digital writing paper.
