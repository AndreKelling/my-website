  description: A presentation about that web technology
---
During my employeetime at <a href="https://inviqa.de/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="my former employer">inviqa</a> i had good chances to do researches on a recent web technology. I started to prepare a presentation as a slidedeck and wrote a <a href="https://inviqa.com/blog/service-workers-guide-building-offline-web-experiences" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="blog entry on inviqa site">blog entry</a>. Which is now authored by a former good colleague. I don't know why. But you can see my origin in the little debugging gif animation on the blog entry.

A Service Worker is a good technology partner to improve a websites <strong>performance</strong> and provide an <strong>offline</strong> experience for a returning visitor.<br />
<strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong> do rely on.
