Relaunched the website as a simple static page. Easy as that. <strong>High running performance of course.</strong> Used a nice <strong>page transition technique</strong> like on this website too. The Fetch API is just fine for that.

From first plans until the first buildings of Vera C. Ritters <strong>co-working spaces and atelier studios</strong> I provided her my support and took care for the right web-presentation.

Content fulfillment and Consulting about <em>internet and web topics </em>are part of this work.
