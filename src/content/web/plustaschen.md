  description: Offer creation with calculator for printing bags

Here i took over a project for a bags printing service provider from his former agency.
The website was in a shape thats needs the right finish to go live.

So defining <strong>business goals and review the projects code</strong> was the first step in that journey.
Simply discovering and unwiring the confusion which laid over there o.O

The customer came up with <strong>further feature ideas</strong> like an individual price pricing.

Which of course was bit beyond programming the default WordPress templates.
Beside that we optimized the <a href="https://plustaschen.de/taschen/turnbeutel-der-bunte" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="check the claculator!">bags calculator form</a> for creating an offer which goes out as mail to the applicant.

Furthermore, I consult the customer about <strong>SEO</strong> and distribute best skills on his <strong>server's administrational needs</strong>.

We are still improving the website bit by bit inside an <strong>agile workflow</strong> based on Trello Cards.

Also improved with live stocks availability display for the customer.
